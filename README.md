# Motion-Detection-Signal-Processing
Work in progress. Detects motion of a live feed on a bird. Records times when motion occurs as well as punishment behavior. 
Motion Detector file signals when the bird moved and what time it moved at. It also records when the bird is 'punished' (light is turned off) and when this occurs.
Counter files measure how often the bird is moved and punished as well as for how long the movement or punishment lasts.
